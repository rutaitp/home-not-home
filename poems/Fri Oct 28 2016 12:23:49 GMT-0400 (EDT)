When home has been so taken or never given to so many of us for so long
We can be home for each other
I am trying to be home for everyone I meet
If even
For a moment
Lay your guard down
Our guns down
Let your shoulders rise
Bagless
The unbearable lightness of being
Home
I will be honest with you and offer that you
Can do the same with me
And I will
Love you to the best of my ability
Home
Let us provide
For each other
Home in the micro moments
In which our humanness is most distinct
We can make houses with the raw material the earth has birthed for us
To make our second home of and within our first
But we can also make home amongst each other
I am trying to smile safety to you
You need not worry here
With me
I am nowhere near perfect
Home
Welcome
