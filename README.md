# Home Not Home

**Home No Home** is a collaboration project with @Daniel-hershel for Programming A2Z Class at ITP, NYU.

With the open world, more and more people are living outside their own countries.
During different historic periods of time, people migrated for different reasons: wars made people flee their homes because of danger and looking for safety, various economic crisis made them migrate looking for a better life in terms of economic conditions. In many cases now people move simply because the global and open world lets us do so.

**The goal of this project is** to explore the concept of “home” and leave a set of collective memory for future generations.

**Project has two parts:** Twitter bot that invites people to share where is home to them and an interactive poem, crowdsourced from people's responses.
